## Overview

The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset used in machine learning and data science for binary classification tasks. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on [Kaggle's Titanic competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It contains the following two files:

- `train.csv`: training dataset with features and labels.
- `test.csv`: test dataset containing unlabeled features.

## Introduction

Open the Google Colab notebook from the following link:
